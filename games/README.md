### Introduction

In this project we implemented an AI player for the game Othello, also known as Reversi. For the rules of this game see here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). Our version of the game differs from these rules in one minor point: The game ends as soon as one of the players has no legal moves left.
